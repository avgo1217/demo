    "    <li><b>What is read_csv and how does it work? </b> read_csv is a predefined function that's part of the pandas package. It is able to take in a csv file, iterate through every row and column, and create a dataframe where you can apply powerful data analysis and visualization functions easily.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>What does \"pd\" stand for? </b> When we wrote <b>import</b> pandas <b>as</b> pd, we were importing the entire pandas library (i.e. all of the modules contained within the library) and making it accessible under the variable <i>pandas</i>. <i>pd</i> is simply an alias for pandas to limit the typing required. We could replace every pd with pandas and the code would work just fine. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Why is there a \".\" before the read_csv function? </b> The \".\" is known as the dot notation and it applies many languages outside of Python. To fully explain the theory, we'd have to get into Object Oriented Programming, a paradigm in which everything is organized around objects rather that \"actions.\" The pandas library, which we have just now called pd has many methods associated with it, one of which is the read_csv method. We access the methods associated with pd by using the dot \".\". So the pandas read_csv method is just written pd.read_csv. This is an important concept to understand as you go on but for now, think of the dot notation as a way of specifying that you want to call the read_csv function from the pandas library.</li>\n",

Depending on what the clients have, we have to make sure we understand the format and requirements in order to be able to use it within the Python environment.\n",

    "In other words, it is the process of replacing a specified number of extreme values with a smaller data value. Note that the data points are modified, not trimmed/removed. Winsorization basically works in two steps:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> First we specify the total percentage of untouched data we want to winsorize. For example, if you want to Winsorize the top 5% and bottom 5% of data points, this is equal to 100% – 5% – 5% = 90% Winsorization. A 80% Winsorization means that 10% is modified from each tail area.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Then we replace the extreme values by the maximum and/or minimum values at the threshold. You could choose to add a little more to the larger/smaller values to account for their weights.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING**: Depending on how much we decide to winsorize, we could potentially introduce a lot of bias to our analysis. Therefore, finding the right range is usually an iterative process. At a grander scale, indiscriminantly winsorizing is not good practice either. We must be careful when treating for outliers since sometimes, there are hidden gems of information stored at the extremes that could lead to valuable insight. In this case, we are consioucly getting rid of extreme loan and applicant income amounts."
